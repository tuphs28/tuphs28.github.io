Hi! I'm Tom! 

I am currently a DPhil student within the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/) at the university of Oxford. Until recently, I was a [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) scholar supervised by [Adria Garriga-Alonso](https://agarri.ga/), and a research assistant at Krueger AI Safety Lab supervised by [Prof David Krueger](https://davidscottkrueger.com/), and working with [Usman Anwar](https://uzman-anwar.github.io/) and [Stephen Chung](https://stephen-c.com/).  Before that, I was a MPhil student in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, and a BSc student in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at LSE. 

My goal is to ensure advanced AI lives up to its potential to benefit humanity. My current research revolves around the unifying theme of safe, beneficial and reliable AI. A few of the many questions I am currently interested in are as follows:

1. How can we teach models to reason in a safe and reliable fashion? How can we verify whether models reason in such a way?
2. How can we increase societal resilience to security threats posed by autonomous intelligent systems?
3. How can we teach models to pursue the ends we want them to pursue?
4. How can advances in AI be deployed to benefit humanity at scale?
